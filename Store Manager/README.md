# Store Manager Project
## **Purpose of this project**
In this project I wanted to explore general object oriented programming principles available for python. And to see how it differs from java and other languages. 

## **What does it do**
This program reads items from either the csv file through the read_from_csv() method or allows the user to individually add items to a store database. Currently the program only reads from csv, feel free to add an append method to add new data. The user is also able to apple discounts increase prices from eact item. There is also a Phone class that adds additional attributes unique to its class. 

## **How to run the program for yourself**
You can either clone or directly download the files from github and either add to the items.csv file or add individual items in the main.py file. No additional files or libraries are required to run this program, besides other than the standard python library.
